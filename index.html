            <div class="step-section" id="power-connection">
                <h3>üîå Check Power Connection</h3>
                <p>Start by examining all power connections. For desktop computers, ensure the power cord is firmly connected to both the computer and the wall outlet. Check that any power strips or surge protectors are turned on and functioning. For laptops, verify the charging cable is properly connected and the charging indicator light is working.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="reconnect-power">
                <h3>üîÑ Reconnect Power Cable</h3>
                <p>Unplug the power cable completely and wait 10 seconds. This allows any residual power to drain from the system. Reconnect the cable firmly, ensuring it clicks or seats properly. For laptops, try removing and reinserting the battery if possible, then connect the AC adapter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="test-outlet">
                <h3>‚ö° Test Different Outlet</h3>
                <p>Plug another device (like a lamp or phone charger) into the same outlet to verify it's working. If the outlet is dead, try a different one. For power strips, test the strip with another device or plug your computer directly into a wall outlet to eliminate the strip as a potential problem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="replace-psu">
                <h3>üîß Replace Power Supply</h3>
                <p>If you've confirmed the outlet works but your computer still shows no signs of life, the power supply unit (PSU) may be faulty. This requires technical skills - you'll need to disconnect all power cables inside the computer, remove the old PSU, and install a replacement with the same wattage and connector types.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="beep-codes">
                <h3>üîä Count Beep Pattern</h3>
                <p>Computer beeps are diagnostic codes. Count the number of beeps and note the pattern (short beeps, long beeps, pauses between groups). Write down the exact sequence - for example: "3 short beeps, pause, 2 long beeps." Each motherboard manufacturer uses different beep codes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="lookup-beep">
                <h3>üìã Look Up Beep Code</h3>
                <p>Search online for your computer's make and model plus "beep codes" or check your motherboard manual. Common patterns: 1 long + 2 short beeps often indicates graphics card issues, while continuous beeping usually means RAM problems. The beep code will tell you which component to focus on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="replace-component">
                <h3>üîß Replace Indicated Component</h3>
                <p>Based on the beep code diagnosis, replace or reseat the faulty component. Most commonly this involves RAM (memory modules) or the graphics card. Always power off and unplug the computer before opening the case. Handle components carefully and ground yourself to prevent static damage.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="internal-connections">
                <h3>üîç Check Internal Connections</h3>
                <p>Open the computer case and inspect all internal cables. Look for loose power connectors to the motherboard (24-pin main power and 4/8-pin CPU power), hard drive SATA and power cables, and RAM modules. Gently but firmly push all connections to ensure they're properly seated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="reseat-components">
                <h3>üîÑ Reseat RAM and Cables</h3>
                <p>Remove RAM modules by opening the retention clips and pulling straight up. Clean the contacts with a soft cloth and reinsert firmly until the clips snap back into place. Do the same for the graphics card and any expansion cards. Reconnect all internal cables, ensuring they're fully inserted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="test-monitor">
                <h3>üñ•Ô∏è Test Different Monitor</h3>
                <p>Connect a different monitor or TV to your computer using the same cable type. If you have multiple video outputs (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA), try different ports. Some computers default to integrated graphics instead of a dedicated graphics card, so try both motherboard and graphics card outputs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="graphics-issue">
                <h3>üéÆ Graphics Card Issue</h3>
                <p>If the monitor works with other devices but not your computer, the graphics card may be faulty. Try reseating the graphics card in its slot. If you have integrated graphics, remove the graphics card temporarily and connect the monitor to the motherboard's video output to test.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="boot-order">
                <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Check Boot Device Order</h3>
                <p>Enter BIOS/UEFI setup (usually by pressing F2, F12, or Delete during startup). Navigate to the boot options and ensure your hard drive is listed and set as the primary boot device. If the drive isn't detected, check its power and data cable connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="hardware-diagnostics">
                <h3>üî¨ Run Hardware Diagnostics</h3>
                <p>Many computers have built-in diagnostic tools accessible during startup (often F12 or F10). These tests can identify failing hard drives, bad RAM, or other hardware issues. You can also create bootable diagnostic tools like MemTest86 for RAM testing or manufacturer-specific utilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="recovery-media">
                <h3>üíæ Boot from Recovery Media</h3>
                <p>Create a bootable USB drive or DVD with your operating system's recovery tools. Boot from this media to access repair options. For Windows, use the "Startup Repair" option. For Mac, boot into Recovery Mode. This can fix corrupted boot files without losing your data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step-section" id="repair-os">
                <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Repair or Reinstall OS</h3>
                <p>If recovery tools don't work, you may need to reinstall the operating system. Back up important data first if possible. A clean OS installation often resolves persistent software issues but will require reinstalling programs and restoring data from backups.</p>
